# Task Manager Extension
## Chrome Task Manager Extension 

Task Manager Features: 
- Clean and interactive UI that allows users to create, edit, delete and complete their daily tasks.
- Syncs data between chrome devices using the **Chrome Storage API** allowing users to access their tasks from multiple devices.
- Features an app icon bage, task counter, and automatically deletes completed tasks each night.

The motivation behind Task Manager was to create a task managing application that solved the problems I had with other task managers. Some of the issues I wanted
to address were: improving accessiblity by making the application accessible from inside the browser, syncing tasks between devices, showing completed tasks and daily progress. Task Manager solves these issues and provides a simple solution, one that I have enjoyed using for almost a year.
